    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let a = 6
    // let b = a
    // console.log(a, b);
    // a = 7
    // console.log(a, b);
    // b參考的是a的值，兩個記憶體位置不同，所以改動a，b不會變
    // 原始型別 call by value 

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    const team = players
    // console.log(team);
    // team[3] = "julia"
    // console.log(team);
    // console.log(players);
    // 因為team參考的是players的記憶體位置，所以改動team陣列的值，players也會變
    // 物件型別 call by reference
    // and we want to make a copy of it.


    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!


    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team4 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[3] = 'julia'
    team2[3] = 'cash'
    team3[3] = 'miya'
    team4[3] = 'sylar'
    // console.log(players, team2, team3, team4, team5);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const driver = person
    // driver.number = 99
    // console.log(person, driver);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // const driver2 = Object.assign({},person, {number: 99, age: 23})
    // console.log(person, driver2);
    

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const julia = {
      name: 'julia',
      age: 40,
      social: {
        facebook: '@aaa',
        instagram: '@bbb'
      }
    }
    // const dev = Object.assign({}, julia)
    // const dev = {...julia}
    const dev = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(julia))
    dev.social.instagram = '@ccc'
    console.log(julia, dev);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
